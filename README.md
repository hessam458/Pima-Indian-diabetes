ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Steps
Handling Missing Values:

Zero values are considered missing in columns like Insulin, BloodPressure, BMI, and SkinThickness.

These zeroes are replaced using appropriate statistics:

Insulin: Replaced by the mean value based on Outcome (separately for diabetic and non-diabetic).

BloodPressure: Replaced by the median.

BMI: Replaced by the mean.

SkinThickness: Replaced by the median.

Data Inspection:

Used .describe() to get summary statistics before and after cleaning.

Used .corr() to examine correlations between variables.

ðŸ“Š Libraries Used
pandas

numpy
